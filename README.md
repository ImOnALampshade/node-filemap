# node-filemap
Windows file mapping/shared memory node module.

I needed this API to mess with offscreen rendering in electron, but the only module I could find to do it was [mmap-io](https://github.com/ozra/mmap-io), and I couldn't get it to work. So I decided to make a windows specific API, so people can use this on Windows and use that, or [node-mmap](https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-mmap) on Linux operating systems.

# Installation
